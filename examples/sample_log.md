# DevLog - Daily Development Log
*A record of daily learnings, decisions, and reflections*

## 2025-07-28 - Daily Log (09:15)

### ðŸ“š What I Learned Today
Learned about Docker multi-stage builds to optimize image size. Managed to reduce our production image from 1.2GB to 300MB by separating build dependencies from runtime dependencies. The key was using alpine base images and copying only necessary artifacts.

### ðŸš€ Decision That Moved My Project Forward
Decided to implement Redis caching for our API responses. Based on our query patterns analysis, this should reduce database load by approximately 70% and improve response times for frequently accessed data.

### What I'm Unclear About / What's Bothering Me
Still struggling with intermittent websocket connection drops in production. Need to investigate whether it's a load balancer configuration issue or something at the application level. The logs aren't giving clear indicators.

### ðŸ“š What I Learned Today
Discovered that our websocket issues were caused by nginx proxy_read_timeout being too low. Set it to 60s and the connection drops stopped. Also learned about nginx sticky sessions for websocket load balancing.

### ðŸš€ Decision That Moved My Project Forward
Implemented proper error boundaries in our React components. This will prevent the entire app from crashing when individual components fail, much better user experience.

### What I'm Unclear About / What's Bothering Me
The team is split on whether to use TypeScript for the new microservice. I'm leaning towards it for better type safety, but some developers are concerned about the learning curve and development speed.

### ðŸ“š What I Learned Today
Learned about PostgreSQL partial indexes and how they can significantly improve query performance for conditional queries. Used them to optimize our user search functionality - query time dropped from 200ms to 15ms.

### ðŸš€ Decision That Moved My Project Forward
Finally convinced the team to adopt TypeScript for the new microservice. Created a simple setup guide and offered to pair program with team members who need help. The type safety benefits are worth the initial investment.

### What I'm Unclear About / What's Bothering Me
Feeling a bit overwhelmed with the current sprint workload. We have the Redis implementation, TypeScript migration, and two critical bug fixes all due by Friday. Need to discuss prioritization with the PM.

### ðŸ“š What I Learned Today
Learned about GitHub Actions for automating our CI/CD pipeline. Set up automatic testing and deployment for the main branch. The yaml syntax is a bit tricky but the automation is powerful.

### ðŸš€ Decision That Moved My Project Forward
Discussed sprint priorities with PM and we agreed to postpone the Redis implementation to next sprint. This gives us breathing room to focus on the critical bug fixes and TypeScript setup without burning out.

### ðŸ¤” What I'm Unclear About / What's Bothering Me
One of the critical bugs seems to be a race condition in our payment processing. It's hard to reproduce consistently, which makes debugging challenging. Might need to add more detailed logging to track down the issue.
